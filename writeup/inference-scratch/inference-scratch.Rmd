# Introduction

What are the goals of inference?
 - Select the model
 - Estimate the model parameters
 - Estimate confidence intervals for the parameters

What challenges are unique to inference in LAGR models?
 - Selecting the bandwidth
 - LAGR is not a linear smoother, so estimating degrees of freedom is difficult
 - LAGR uses lasso, so estimating distributions of coefficient estimates is difficult

Why use AIC?
 - Likelihood is the basis for most statistical inference
 - The likelihood can be used for model selection and estimation
 - Using the same data for selection and estimation produces a downward-biased estimate of the likelihood
 - The AIC is bias-corrected likelihood
 - Computing AIC requires an expression for the degrees of freedom used in estimating a model
 
Why use the bootstrap?
