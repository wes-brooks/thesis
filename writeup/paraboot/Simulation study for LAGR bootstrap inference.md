#Data
The data was simulated as follows. There are four covariates, each simulated by drawing 400 uniformly spaced observations from Gaussian random fields (GRFs) on the domain [0,1] x [0,1]. The GRFs are simulated with exponential covariance (range parameter $\tau=0.1$, variance parameter $\phi=1$, and nugget parameter $\sigma^2=0.2$). The first three coefficients are generated from GRFs with progressively smaller influence. All three have range parameter $\tau=1$ and nugget parameter $\sigma^2=0$, while the variance parameters were set to $\phi = 10, 1, 0.1$, respectively. The fourth coefficient was exactly zero on the entire domain.

The simulated response is $Y(s) = X^T(s)\beta(s) + \varepsilon(s)$ where $X^T(s)$ is the vector of covariates at $s$, $\beta(s)$ is the vector of coefficients at $s$, and $\varepsilon(s)$ is a random error at $s$. The random error vector $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$ is generated by simulating 400 independent observations from a Gaussian distribution with mean zero and variance $0.25$.
