Whereas the coefficients in traditional linear regression are scalar constants,
 the coefficients in a varying coefficient regression (VCR) model are functions
 - often

emph{smooth} functions - of some effect modifying variable

citep{Hastie:1993a}.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The methodology described herein is applicable to geostatistical data and
 areal data.
 Let $
\backslash
mathcal{D}$ be a spatial domain on which data is collected.
 For geostatistical data, let $
\backslash
bm{s}$ denote a location in $
\backslash
mathcal{D}$.
 Let a univariate spatial process $
\backslash
left
\backslash
{Y(
\backslash
bm{s}) : 
\backslash
bm{s} 
\backslash
in 
\backslash
mathcal{D}
\backslash
right
\backslash
}$ and a possibly multivariate spatial process $
\backslash
left
\backslash
{
\backslash
bm{X}(
\backslash
bm{s}) : 
\backslash
bm{s} 
\backslash
in 
\backslash
mathcal{D}
\backslash
right
\backslash
}$ denote random fields of the response and the covariates, respectively.
 For $i = 1, 
\backslash
dots, n$, let $
\backslash
bm{s}_i$ denote the sampling location in $
\backslash
mathcal{D}$ of the $i$th observation of the response and the covariates.
 Let the observed data be denoted $
\backslash
left
\backslash
{y(
\backslash
bm{s}_i), 
\backslash
bm{x}(
\backslash
bm{s}_i)
\backslash
right
\backslash
}$, $i=1, 
\backslash
dots, n$.
 Then the data are a realization of the random fields at the sampling locations
 $
\backslash
left
\backslash
{Y(
\backslash
bm{s}_i), 
\backslash
bm{X}(
\backslash
bm{s}_i)
\backslash
right
\backslash
}$ for $i=1, 
\backslash
dots, n$.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For areal data, the spatial domain $
\backslash
mathcal{D}$ is partitioned into $n$ regions $
\backslash
{D_1, 
\backslash
dots, D_n
\backslash
}$ such that $
\backslash
mathcal{D} = 
\backslash
bigcup 
\backslash
limits_{i=1}^n D_i$.
 In the case of areal data, the random variables $
\backslash
left
\backslash
{Y(D_i), 
\backslash
bm{X}(D_i)
\backslash
right
\backslash
}$ are defined for regions instead of for point locations; population and
 spatial mean temperature are examples of areal data.
 The analytical method described herein can be applied to areal data if
 they are recast as geostatistical data by assuming that the data are point-refe
renced to a representative location of each region, such as the centroid.
 That is, $
\backslash
left
\backslash
{
\backslash
bm{X}(
\backslash
bm{s}_i), Y(
\backslash
bm{s}_i)
\backslash
right
\backslash
} $ where $
\backslash
bm{s}_i$ is the centroid of $D_i$ for $i=1, 
\backslash
dots, n$.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Common practice in the analysis of geostatistical and areal data is to model
 the response variable with a spatial linear regression model consisting
 of the sum of a fixed mean function, a spatial random effect, and random
 error all on domain $
\backslash
mathcal{D}$, as in: 
\backslash
begin{align}
\backslash
label{eq:spatial-regression} Y(
\backslash
bm{s}) = 
\backslash
bm{X}(
\backslash
bm{s})'
\backslash
bm{
\backslash
beta} + W(
\backslash
bm{s}) + 
\backslash
varepsilon(
\backslash
bm{s}) 
\backslash
end{align} where $
\backslash
bm{X}(
\backslash
bm{s})'
\backslash
bm{
\backslash
beta}$ is the mean function consisting of a vector of covariates $
\backslash
bm{X}(
\backslash
bm{s})$, and a vector of regression coefficients $
\backslash
bm{
\backslash
beta}$.
 The random error $
\backslash
varepsilon(
\backslash
bm{s})$ denotes white noise such that the errors are independent and identically
 distributed with mean zero and variance $
\backslash
sigma^2$, while the random component $W(
\backslash
bm{s})$ denotes a mean-zero, second-order stationary random field that is
 independent of the random error.
 The mean function captures the large-scale systematic trend of the response,
 the spatial random field $W(
\backslash
bm{s})$ can be thought of as a small-scale spatial random effect, and the
 error term $
\backslash
varepsilon(
\backslash
bm{s})$ captures micro-scale variation 
\backslash
citep{Cressie:1993}.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It is common to pre-specify the form of a covariance function for the spatial
 random effect $W(
\backslash
bm{s})$ 
\backslash
citep{Diggle:2007}.
 For example, the exponential covariance function (a special case of the
 Mat
\backslash
'{e}rn class of covariance functions) has the form 
\backslash
begin{align}
\backslash
label{eq:exponential-covariance} 
\backslash
text{Cov}(W(
\backslash
bm{s}), W(
\backslash
bm{t})) = 
\backslash
sigma^2 
\backslash

\backslash

\backslash
{-
\backslash
phi^{-1} 
\backslash
delta(
\backslash
bm{s}, 
\backslash
bm{t}) 
\backslash
right
\backslash
} 
\backslash
end{align} where $
\backslash
sigma^2$ is a variance parameter, $
\backslash
phi$ is a range parameter, and $
\backslash
delta(
\backslash
bm{s}, 
\backslash
bm{t})$ is the Euclidean distance between locations $
\backslash
bm{s}$ and $
\backslash
bm{t}$.
 The general form of a covariance function in the Mat
\backslash
'{e}rn class is 
\backslash
begin{align}
\backslash
label{eq:matern-covarinace} 
\backslash
text{Cov}(W(
\backslash
bm{s}), W(
\backslash
bm{t})) =

bm{s}, 
\backslash
bm{t}) 
\backslash
phi^{-1}
\backslash
sqrt{2
\backslash
nu}
\backslash
right) 
\backslash
end{align} where $
\backslash
nu$ denotes the degree of smoothness, $K_{
\backslash
nu}$ denotes the modified Bessel equation of the second kind, and as before
 $
\backslash
phi$ denotes a range parameter and $
\backslash
delta(
\backslash
bm{s}, 
\backslash
bm{t})$ the Euclidean distance between locations $
\backslash
bm{s}$ and $
\backslash
bm{t}$.
 The exponential covariance function corresponds to a Mat
\backslash
'{e}rn class covariance function with $
\backslash
nu = 1/2$.

%SVCR - justification %Stationarity in spatial linear regression A random
 field is said to be stationary if the joint distribution of a the response
 at a finite set of locations does not change when the set of locations
 are all shifted in space by a fixed spatial lag.
 That is, letting $
\backslash
left
\backslash
{T(
\backslash
bm{s}) : 
\backslash
bm{s} 
\backslash
in 
\backslash
mathcal{D}
\backslash

\backslash
mathcal{D}$ that takes value $T(
\backslash
bm{s}_i)$ at location $
\backslash
bm{s}_i 
\backslash
in 
\backslash
mathcal{D}$ for $i = 1, 
\backslash
dots, n$, the random field $T(
\backslash
bm{s})$ is stationary if $F_n
\backslash
left(T(
\backslash
bm{s}_1), 
\backslash
dots, T(
\backslash
bm{s}_n)
\backslash
right) = F_n
\backslash
left(T(
\backslash
bm{s}_1+
\backslash
bm{h}), 
\backslash
dots, T(
\backslash
bm{s}_n+
\backslash
bm{h})
\backslash
right)$ where $F_n(
\backslash
cdot)$ is the joint distribution of a length $n$ sample from $T(
\backslash
bm{s})$ and $
\backslash
bm{h}$ is a fixed spatial lag.
 The random field $
\backslash
left
\backslash
{T(
\backslash
bm{s}) : 
\backslash
bm{s} 
\backslash
in 
\backslash
mathcal{D}
\backslash

\backslash
}$ is second-order stationary if the following are satisfied:

\backslash
end{align} where the function $C(
\backslash
cdot)$ depends only on the spatial lag $
\backslash
bm{h}$ and not on the location $
\backslash
bm{s}$.
 %the joint distribution at any two locations in the domain does not change
 when the locations are shifted by a fixed spatial lag.

The coefficient vector $
\backslash
bm{
\backslash
beta}$ in (
\backslash
ref{eq:spatial-regression}) is a fixed constant.
 The model can be made more flexible if the coefficients are described by
 a stationary random field.
 Such a model is written 
\backslash
begin{align}
\backslash
label{eq:SVCR-process} Y(
\backslash
bm{s}) = 
\backslash
bm{X}(
\backslash
bm{s})'
\backslash
bm{
\backslash
beta}(
\backslash
bm{s}) + 
\backslash
varepsilon(
\backslash
bm{s}) 
\backslash
end{align} where $
\backslash
bm{
\backslash
beta}(
\backslash
bm{s})$ is a random coefficient field with a Mat
\backslash
'{e}rn-class covariance function and the spatial random effect $W(
\backslash
bm{s})$ included in the intercept $
\backslash
beta_0(
\backslash
bm{s})$.
 The random coefficient field $
\backslash
bm{
\backslash
beta}(
\backslash
bm{s})$ can be estimated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods under
 the assumption that $
\backslash
bm{
\backslash
beta}(
\backslash
bm{s})$ is stationary 
\backslash
citep{Gelfand:2003}.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
%The spatial random effect describes the spatial pattern in the deviations
 from the systematic part of the model.
 When fitting the spatial regression model (
\backslash
ref{eq:spatial-regression}), it is usually required that the the fitted
 values of the spatial random effect and of the residuals sum to zero, i.e.
 $
\backslash
sum
\backslash
limits_{i=1}^n
\backslash
hat{W}(
\backslash
bm{s}_i) = 0$ and $
\backslash
sum
\backslash
limits_{i=1}^n
\backslash
hat{
\backslash
varepsilon}(
\backslash
bm{s}_i) = 0$.
 This mode of analysis is appropriate when the systematic part of the regression
 model does not vary between locations.
 On the other hand, a VCR model is appropriate for the case where the systematic
 part of the regression model does vary across locations.

%Spatial VCR Alternatively, kernel-based and spline-based methods can be
 considered for fitting VCR models without assuming the coefficients are
 described by a stationary random field.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Coefficients for a spline-based VCR model are estimated by maximizing a
 penalized global likelihood, with the penalty calculated from the wiggliness
 of the coefficient surface 
\backslash
citep{Wood:2006}.
 This contrasts to kernel-based estimates of the coefficients in a VCR model,
 which maximize a local likelihood to estimate the local coefficients at
 each sampling location 
\backslash
citep{Loader:1999}.
 
\backslash
cite{Fan:1999} demonstrated that the optimal kernel bandwidth estimate for
 a VCR model can be found via a two-step technique.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Model selection in VCR models may be local or global.
 Global selection means including or excluding variables everywhere in the
 spatial domain, while local selection means including or excluding variables
 at individual locations within the spatial domain.
 For global model selection in spline-based VCR models, 
\backslash
cite{Wang:2008a} proposed a SCAD penalty 
\backslash
citep{Fan:2001} for variable selection in spline-based VCR models with a
 univariate effect-modifying variable.
 
\backslash
cite{Antoniadis:2012a} used the nonnegative Garrote penalty 
\backslash
citep{Breiman:1995} in P-spline-based VCR models having a univariate effect-modi
fying variable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Wavelet methods for fitting SVCR models were explored by 
\backslash
cite{Shang-2011} and 
\backslash
cite{Zhang-2011}.
 Sparsity in the wavelet coefficients is achieved either by $
\backslash
ell_1$-penalization (also known as the Lasso 
\backslash
citep{Tibshirani:1996}) 
\backslash
citep{Shang-2011} or by Bayesian variable selection 
\backslash
citep{Zhang-2011}.
 Sparsity in the wavelet domain does not imply sparsity in the covariates,
 though, so neither method is suitable for local variable selection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is a kernel-based method for estimating
 the coefficients of an SVCR model where the kernel weights are based on
 the distance between sampling locations 
\backslash
citep{Brundson:1998a, Fotheringham:2002}.
 At each sampling location, traditional GWR estimates the local regression
 coefficients by the local likelihood 
\backslash
citep{Loader:1999}.
 As a kernel-based smoother for regression coefficients, traditional GWR
 tends to exhibit bias near the boundary of the region being modeled 
\backslash
citep{Hastie:1993b}.
 One way to reduce the boundary-effect bias is to model the coefficient
 surface as locally linear rather than locally constant by including coefficient
-by-location interactions 
\backslash
citep{Wang:2008b}.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Current practice for VCR models relies on 
\shape italic
a priori
\shape default
 global model selection to decide which variables should be included in
 the model.
 The idea of using Lasso regularization for local variable selection in
 a VCR model has appeared in the literature as the geographically weighted
 Lasso (GWL) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Wheeler-2009"

\end_inset

.
 The GWL applies the Lasso for local variable selection and uses a jackknife
 criterion for selection of the Lasso tuning parameters.
 However, there are several drawbacks to the GWL.
 First, the GWL is a lasso procedure, but the lasso does not generally produce
 consistent estimates of the relevant covariates 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Leng-2006"

\end_inset

.
 Because the jackknife criterion can only be computed at sampling locations
 where the response variable is observed, the GWL cannot be used to impute
 missing values of the response variable nor to interpolate the coefficient
 surface and/or the response variable between sampling locations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The adaptive Lasso (AL) 
\backslash
citep{Zou:2006} is an improvement to the Lasso that does produce consistent
 estimates of the coefficients and has been shown to have appealing properties
 for automating variable selection, which under suitable conditions include
 the ``oracle" property of asymptotically selecting exactly the correct
 set of covariates for inclusion in a regression model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The remainder of this document is organized as follows.
 In Section 
\backslash
ref{section:simulation}, a simulation study is conducted to assess the performan
ce of the GWEN in variable selection and coefficient estimation.
 An application to real data is presented in Section

Since there are a total of

 maximize the total likelihood.
 But since the coefficient functions are smooth, the coefficients at location
 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{s}$

 can approximate the coefficients within some neighborhood of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{s}$

\begin_layout Standard
To prove the oracle properties of LAGR, we assumed that

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $hn^{-1/2}b_{n}\xrightarrow{p}\infty$

 Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{-1}n^{-1/2}\lambda_{n}(\bm{s})\to0$

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $j\le p_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $hn^{-1/2}\lambda_{n}(\bm{s})\|\bm{\zeta}_{j}(\bm{s})\|^{-\gamma}\to\infty$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $j>p_{0}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We require that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{n}(\bm{s})$
\end_inset

 can satisfy both assumptions.
 Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{n}(\bm{s})=n^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

, and recall that 
\begin_inset Formula $h=O(n^{-1/6})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\|\tilde{\bm{\zeta}}_{p}(\bm{s})\|=O(h^{-1}n^{-1/2})$

 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{-1}n^{-1/2}\lambda_{n}(\bm{s})=O(n^{-1/3+\alpha})$

).
 The first is a step function, which is equal to zero in 40% of the spatial
 domain, equal to one in a different 40% of the spatial domain, and increases
 linearly in the middle 20% of the domain.
 The second is a gradient function, which increases linearly from zero at
 one end of the domain to one at the other.
 The final coefficient function is a parabola taking its maximum value of
 1 at the center of the domain and falling to zero at each corner of the
 domain.

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proposed LAGR method was accurate in selection and estimation, with
 estimation accuracy for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1}(\bm{s})$
\end_inset

 about equal to that of the VCR model with no selection, and with consistently
 better accuracy for estimating 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{2}(\bm{s}),\dots,\beta_{5}(\bm{s})$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was minimal difference in the performance of the proposed LAGR method
 between low (
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\varepsilon}=0.5$
\end_inset

) and high (
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\varepsilon}=1$
\end_inset

) error variance, and between no (
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=0$
\end_inset

) and moderate (
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=0.5$
\end_inset

) correlation among the predictor variables.
 But the selection and estimation accuracy did decline when there was high
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=0.9$
\end_inset

) correlation among the predictor variables.

The proposed LAGR estimation method was used to estimate the coefficients
 in a VCR model of the effect of some covariates on the price of homes in
 Boston.
 The data source is the Boston house price data set of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Harrison-Rubinfeld-1978,Gilley-Pace-1996,Pace-Gilley-1997"

\end_inset

, which is based on the 1970 U.S.
 census.
 In the data, we have the median price of homes sold in 506 census tracts
 (MEDV), along with some potential predictor variables.
 The predictor variables are CRIM (the per-capita crime rate in the tract),
 RM (the mean number of rooms for houses sold in the tract), RAD (an index
 of how accessible the tract is from Boston's radial roads), TAX (the property
 tax per $10,000 of property value), and LSTAT (the percentage of the tract's
 residents who are considered

\begin_layout Standard
One interesting result is that LAGR indicates that the TAX variable was
 nowhere an important predictor of the median house price.
 Another is that the coefficients of CRIM and LSTAT are everywhere negative
 or zero (meaning that the increasing the crime rate or proportion of lower-stat
us individuals reduces the median house price where the effect is discernable)
 and that of RM is positive (meaning that when the average house in a tract
 has more rooms, the median house will be more expensive), but the coefficient
 of RAD is positive in some areas and negative in others.
 This indicates that there are parts of Boston where improved access to
 radial roads increases the median house price and parts where it decreases
 the median house price.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is not an obvious spatial pattern to the local coefficients for RAD
 - there are more tracts with negative coefficients than positive, and the
 positive coefficients do appear to be clustered, but the tracts with positive
 coefficients are also adjacent to tracts with negative coefficients.
 Indeed, there is not an obvious spatial pattern to any of the coefficient
 surfaces except for TAX, which is zero everywhere.

 that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\bm{\zeta}}_{j}(\bm{s})\xrightarrow{p}\bm{\zeta}_{j}(\bm{s})+\frac{\kappa_{2}h^{2}}{2\kappa_{0}}\{\nabla_{uu}^{2}\bm{\zeta}_{j}(\bm{s})+\nabla_{vv}^{2}\bm{\zeta}_{j}(\bm{s})\}$
\end_inset

, so to complete the proof of selection consistency, it only remains to
 show that 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left\{ \hat{\bm{\zeta}}_{j}(\bm{s})=0\right\} \to1$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $j>p_{0}$

\begin_inset Formula $Q\left\{ \bm{\zeta}(\bm{s})\right\} $
\end_inset

 is differentiable w.r.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{\zeta}_{p}(\bm{s})$
\end_inset

 and is minimized where 
\begin_inset Formula

\begin_layout Standard
From Lemma 2 of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ n^{-1}\bm{Z}_{p}^{T}(\bm{s})\bm{W}(\bm{s})\bm{Z}_{-p}(\bm{s})\right\} =O_{p}(1)$
\end_inset

 and

\begin_layout Standard
From Theorem 3 of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Sun-Yan-Zhang-Lu-2014"

\end_inset

, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula $h\sqrt{n}\left[\hat{\bm{\zeta}}_{-p}(\bm{s})-\bm{\zeta}_{-p}(\bm{s})-\frac{h^{2}\kappa_{2}}{2\kappa_{0}}\left\{ \nabla_{uu}^{2}\zeta_{-p}(\bm{s})+\nabla_{vv}^{2}\zeta_{-p}(\bm{s})\right\} \right]=O_{p}(1)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $h\sqrt{n}\left[\hat{\bm{\zeta}}_{p}(\bm{s})-\bm{\zeta}_{p}(\bm{s})-\frac{h^{2}\kappa_{2}}{2\kappa_{0}}\left\{ \nabla_{uu}^{2}\zeta_{p}(\bm{s})+\nabla_{vv}^{2}\zeta_{p}(\bm{s})\right\} \right]=O_{p}(1)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the second and third terms of the sum in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:selection"

\end_inset

) are 
\begin_inset Formula $O_{p}(1)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We showed in the proof of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 that 
\begin_inset Formula $h\sqrt{n}\bm{Z}_{p}^{T}(\bm{s})\bm{W}(\bm{s})\left[\bm{Y}-\bm{Z}(\bm{s})\bm{\zeta}(\bm{s})-\frac{h^{2}\kappa_{2}}{2\kappa_{0}}\left\{ \nabla_{uu}^{2}\bm{\zeta}(\bm{s})+\nabla_{vv}^{2}\bm{\zeta}(\bm{s})\right\} \right]=O_{p}(1)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The three terms of the sum to the right of the equals sign in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:selection"

\end_inset

) are 
\begin_inset Formula $O_{p}(1)$
\end_inset

, so for 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\bm{\zeta}}_{p}(\bm{s})$
\end_inset

 to be a solution, we must have that 
\begin_inset Formula $hn^{-1/2}\phi_{p}(\bm{s})\hat{\bm{\zeta}}_{p}(\bm{s})/\|\hat{\bm{\zeta}}_{p}(\bm{s})\|=O_{p}(1)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But since by assumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\bm{\zeta}}_{p}(\bm{s})\ne0$
\end_inset

, there must be some 
\begin_inset Formula $k\in\{1,\dots,3\}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $|\hat{\zeta}_{p_{k}}(\bm{s})|=\max\{|\hat{\zeta}_{p_{k'}}(\bm{s})|:1\le k'\le3\}$
\end_inset

.
 And for this 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula $|\hat{\zeta}_{p_{k}}(\bm{s})|/\|\hat{\bm{\zeta}}_{p}(\bm{s})\|\ge1/\sqrt{3}>0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now since 
\begin_inset Formula $hn^{-1/2}b_{n}\to\infty$
\end_inset

, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula $hn^{-1/2}\phi_{p}(\bm{s})\hat{\bm{\zeta}}_{p}(\bm{s})/\|\hat{\bm{\zeta}}_{p}(\bm{s})\|\ge hb_{n}/\sqrt{3n}\to\infty$
\end_inset

 and therefore the term to the left of the equals sign dominates the sum
 to the right of the equals sign in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:selection"

\end_inset

).
 So for large enough 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\bm{\zeta}}_{p}(\bm{s})\ne0$
\end_inset

 cannot maximize 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left\{ \hat{\bm{\zeta}}_{(b)}(\bm{s})=0\right\} \to1$
