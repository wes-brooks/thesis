     SUMMARY:  This collection identifies changes  in  United  States  census  tracts
     between 1980  and  1990.   The  data were derived from the Census Bureau's TIGER
     database.  Counties with 1980 and 1990 census tracts are not included  if  there
     were no  changes  in  the  census  tract  boundaries and/or census tract numbers
     between 1980 and 1990.  Also excluded are counties with  census  tracts  defined
     for the first time in 1990.  CLASS IV                                           
                                                                                     
     UNIVERSE:  All  census  tracts in the United States and Puerto Rico that changed
     between the 1980 and 1990 censuses.                                             
     NOTE:  The data are provided in two formats.  Part 1 presents the information in
     a form  comparable  to  other  Census  Bureau  tape  files  and   suitable   for
     manipulation by  computer.   Part  2 presents the data with a space between each
     field and with a decimal point between the census tract number and  its  suffix.
     This format is designed to make the file easy to read without additional editing
     for those who wish to print out the file.

       This product covers all census tracts in the United States and Puerto Rico    
       that changed between the 1980 and 1990 censuses.

       The Census Bureau produces two different types of census tract comparability  
       products: the TIGER/Census Tract Comparability file and the Census Tract      
       Comparability Tables that appear in the 1990 CPH-3 Population and Housing     
       Characteristics for Census Tracts and Block Numbering Areas reports.          
                                                                                     
       The TIGER/Census Tract Comparability file contains information on all census  
       tract changes. The CPH-3 Census Tract Comparability Tables contain            
       information only for those census tract changes that affect more than 2.5     
       percent of the total 1990 population of the census tract. The census tracts   
       that appear in the 1990 CPH-3 reports are identified by a plus sign (+) in    
       the TIGER/Census Tract Comparability file.                                    
                                                                                     
       The census tract comparability products were created to enable users to       
       identify the relationships among census tracts with changes from 1980 to      
       1990. If a State or county does not appear in the TIGER/Census Tract          
       Comparability file, the area either has no change to the census tracts from   
       the 1980 census, or the 1990 census was the first time that census tracts     
       were delineated for that area.

       The TIGER/Census Tract Comparability file covers all census tracts that       
       changed between the 1980 and 1990 censuses in the 934 counties with 1980      
       census tracts in the United States and Puerto Rico.

       File Structure: File 1, called TRTCMP90.DAT presents the information in the   
       format used for Census Bureau computer tapes; that is, without a decimal      
       point between the basic census tract number and its suffix (if any), and no   
       spaces between fields.                                                        
                                                                                     
       File 2, called TRTCMP90.PRT, has blank spaces separating each field, a        
       decimal point as part of the census tract number where a suffix exists and,   
       when printed, will not need editing to make it easy to read with the human

       Data users who plan only to print the file will find the TRTCMP90.PRT version 
       (File 2) easier to work with. Data users who plan on manipulating the         
       TIGER/Census Tract Comparability file and those expecting files in the format 
       used for other Census Bureau computer files probably will find the            
       TRTCMP90.DAT version (File 1) more useful.

       Record Length: The TRTCMP90.DAT version (File 1) of the file has a record     
                      length of 70 characters while the TRTCMP90.PRT version         
                      (File 2) has a record length of 82 characters.

                 Development of the TIGER/Census Tract Comparability File            
                                                                                     
     The section describes the development of the TIGER/Census Tract Comparability   
     file. As with other products produced for the 1990 census, the TIGER/Census     
     Tract Comparability files use the January 1, 1990 boundaries and geographic     
     area codes for governmental units based on responses to the Boundary and        
     Annexation Survey conducted by the Bureau of the Census. Thus, the TIGER/Census 
     Tract Comparability files reflect the final 1990 census tabulation geographic   
     area boundaries and codes.                                                      
                                                                                     
     The file was developed to identify changes in census tracts from 1980 to 1990.  
     Counties with 1980 census tracts do not appear in the file if there were no     
     changes in the census tract boundaries and/or census tract numbers between 1980 
     and 1990. Counties with census tracts defined for the first time in 1990 are    
     excluded as well.                                                               
                                                                                     
     The file was derived from the Census Bureau's TIGER data base.                  
                                                                                     
     OVERVIEW OF THE TIGER SYSTEM                                                    
                                                                                     
     The U.S. Bureau of the Census, in cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey   
     (USGS), developed a computer-readable geographic data base for the United       
     States and its territories. This system consisting of the TIGER data base and   
     the associated computer software, is called TIGER, an acronym for Topologically 
     Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing.                                 
                                                                                     
     The TIGER System automates the mapping and related geographic activities        
     required to support the census and sample survey programs of the Bureau of      
     the Census, starting with the 1990 decennial census. The TIGER System provides  
     support for:                                                                    
                                                                                     
      Creation and maintenance of a digital geographic data base that includes       
      complete coverage of the United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands of the

     The primary sources of the TIGER data base were the 1: 100,000-scale Digital    
     Line Graph (DLG-3) files from the USGS and the 1980 GBF/DL ME-Files from the    
     Bureau of the Census. The basis for the 1:100,000-scale DLG-3 files is the USGS 
     1: 100,000-scale map sheets. The map sheets were derived from photographically  
     reduced (to 1:100,000-scale) mosaicked 1:24,000-scale USGS maps. The USGS 1:

     100,000-scale maps meet national map accuracy standards and use coordinates     
     defined by the North American Datum, 1927. For the lower 48 States, the         
     cartographic quality of most of the TIGER System, in areas outside the 1980     
     census GBF/DIME-Files coverage and the urban cores of selected other large      
     metropolitan areas, compares favorably with the USGS 1:100,00-scales maps.

     CENSUS TRACT - A small, relatively permanent statistical subdivision of a       
     county in metropolitan areas and selected nonmetropolitan counties, delineated  
     for the purpose of presenting decennial census data. When census tracts are     
     established, they are designed to be relatively homogeneous with respect to     
     population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions, and to      
     contain between 2,500 and 8,000 inhabitants.                                    
                                                                                     
     CENSUS TRACT BOUNDARY - The boundary of a census tract. Census tract            
     boundaries normally follow physical features but may follow governmental unit   
     boundaries and nonvisible features in some instances; they always coincide with 
     county lines. Census tract boundaries are established cooperatively by local    
     census statistical areas committees and the Census Bureau in accordance with    
     Bureau-defined guidelines that specify the need for visible and stable          
     boundaries.                                                                     
                                                                                     
     CENSUS TRACT NUMBER - A 4-digit number, possibly with a 2-digit suffix used to  
     identify a census tract uniquely within a county and usually within a           
     metropolitan area. All valid census tract numbers are in the range 0001 to 9499.
     Leading zeros are not shown on Census Bureau maps.                              
                                                                                     
     CENSUS TRACT NUMBER SUFFIX - The last two digits of a 6-digit census tract      
     number. Valid census tract suffixes are in the range 0 1 to 99. If there is no  
     suffix, this field is blank.                                                    
                                                                                     
     COUNTY - The primary subdivision of a State (except Alaska, where they are      
     called boroughs and census areas; Louisiana, where they are called parishes and 
     independent cities in Maryland, Missouri Nevada and Virginia.) Each usually is  
     a governmental unit, with powers defined by state law.                          
                                                                                     
     COUNTY CODE - A 3-digit FIPS code assigned to each county and statistically     
     equivalent entity in alphabetical order within state; independent cities        
     follow the counties in a state. Gaps are left in the numbering system to        
     accommodate new counties. The county codes are published in FIPS PUB 6.         
                                                                                     
     FEDERAL INFORMATION PROCESSING STANDARDS (FIPS) - A standardized system of      
     coding published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, for     
     use by the Federal Government and other users. Several series of FIPS have been 
     established to identify standard geographic codes for States, counties,         
     metropolitan areas, congressional districts, foreign geographic entities, and   
     named locational entities. Geographic elements to be coded are first            
     alphabetized and then assigned codes serially, generally with systematic gaps   
     that permit additions to the list. The basic geographic code formats published  
     in FIPS Publications (FIPS PUBs) are as follows:

        Counties and statistically equivalent entities - 3 digits (FIPS PUB 6)       
        Metropolitan areas - 4 digits (FIPS PUB 8 )

     FIPS COUNTY CODE - See county code.                                             
                                                                                     
     FIPS STATE CODE - See state code.                                               
                                                                                     
     METROPOLITAN AREA - A generic term for SMA, SMSA, SCSA, MSA, CMSA, and PMSA.    
                                                                                     
     METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREA - A highly populated, economically integrated     
     area defined by the Office of Management and Budget as a Federal statistical    
     standard. An area qualifies for recognition as an MSA in one of two ways: it    
     contains a city of at least 50,000 population, or it contains a Census Bureau-  
     defined urbanized area (minimum population 50,000) with a total metropolitan    
     area population of at least 100,000 (75,000 in New England). In addition to the 
     county(s) containing the main place(s), an MSA also may include additional      
     counties that meet specific standards concerning economic and social ties to    
     the central county(s). MSA's are defined in terms of counties except in the     
     six New England states, where cities and towns (MCDs) are used. Designations of 
     MSA's were first published in June 1983 and went into effect on June 30, 1983.  
     Some Metropolitan Statistical Areas prior to that date were known as Standard   
     Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSAs). See Primary Metropolitan Statistical    
     Area (PMSA).                                                                    
                                                                                     
     MSA/PMSA - See Metropolitan Statistical Area and Primary Metropolitan           
     Statistical Area.                                                               
                                                                                     
     PART INDICATOR FLAG - Metropolitan areas in New England are comprised of        
     cities and towns rather than whole counties. In the TIGER/Census Tract          
     Comparability file, the county part indicator identifies a New England county   
     partially in a 1990 MSA/PMSA, in more than one MSA/PMSA, or both.               
                                                                                     
     PRIMARY METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREA (PMSA) - An area defined by the Office    
     of Management and Budget as a Federal statistical standard. A PMSA consists of  
     one or more counties (cities and towns in New England), within a metropolitan   
     area having a population of 1,000,000 or more, that demonstrate (based on       
     specific standards) very strong internal economic and social links separate     
     from the ties to other portions of the metropolitan area. By definition, a      
     PMSA is always part of a Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA).     
     The term PMSA went into effect on June 30, 1983.                                
                                                                                     
     PMSA - See Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area.                               
                                                                                     
     STATE CODE - The 2-digit FIPS code assigned to each State and statistically     
     area. The FIPS codes are assigned alphabetically including the District of      
     Columbia followed by Puerto Rico and the other territories in alphabetic        
     sequence. The State codes are published in FIPS PUB 5.
