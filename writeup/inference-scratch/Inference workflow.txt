1. Find the bandwidth that minimizes the AIC for the original data
2. Identify the plausible bandwidths (those with AIC within 10 of the minimum)
3. Calculate 10 evenly spaced candidate bandwidths across the plausible bandwidth region
4. For each candidate bandwidth:
    1. Randomly draw iid N(0,1) random numbers, numbering as many as the number of (augmented) covariates
    2. Estimate the model using the original data
    3. Compute the dispersion (residual variance) parameter, sigma^2
    4. At each observation location:
        1. Extract the square root covariance matrix of the WLS coefficients for each local model
        2. For as many bootstrap draws as we'd like:
            1. Multiply the square root covariance matrix by the iid N(0,1) random numbers we previously drew (these are the parametric bootstrap draws of the coefficients)
            2. Multiply the parametric bootstrap coefficients by the covariates to get the systematic portion of the local parametric bootstrap draw
            3. Generate a random error for the local model by drawing a N(0,sigma^2) random number - this is the random portion of the local parametric bootstrap draw
            4. Add the systematic and random portions to compute a local parametric bootstrap response
    5. Now we have our parametric bootstrap draws for this bandwidth
    6. Estimate the local coefficients for each parametric bootstrap draw, using the current bandwidth
    7. Compute the local coefficients estimates (conditional on current bandwidth) as the mean of the local bootstrap estimates
    8. Compute the local coefficient variance estimates (using the method of Efron, 2014?)
5. Calculate a weighted average of the estimated coefficients and variances, where the weights are based on the AIC for each bandwidth
